This is a project for the Brown Data Science CS1951A course. The purpose of this project is to create a recommendation engine for a player in the online game League of Legends. We seek to utilize machine learning practices to deliver personalized strategies to players, and utilize various data visualization tools to help users understand and grasp unique trends. 

This project utilizes the Riot Games API - at the current time the API keys granted to us by Riot only last 24 hours, and even then present no security threat in anyway. Therefore they are not encrypted or hidden in anyway. If you seek to replicate or work on this project, you will likely have to set up a developer account with Riot Games, where there is a portal for generating 24-hr API keys.
